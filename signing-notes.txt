However, GPG still can create such a file
>gpg --export-secret-keys -o secring.gpg

to get short format of keys
>gpg --list-keys --keyid-format short

to export
>gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 1704A2E3
>gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys 1704A2E3

to search
>gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --search-keys 1704A2E3

to purge cached passphrases
>gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
